# Password-Strength-Classifier
This project classifies the strength of a password in 3 categories(0,1 and 2, 2 being the strongest). Here I used different classifiers like 
logistic regisression(multiclass-ovr(one vs rest)),SVM classifiers and XGBoost and XGBoost is the best performing algorithm here.
